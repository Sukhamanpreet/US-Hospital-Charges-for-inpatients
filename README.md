In our analysis, it is found that Maryland state is providing efficient health services at cheapest prices as compared to the rest of the states. No matter, what the treatment is.
On the other hand, California is charging much higher prices to the patient. There is no standard system in the USA responsible for fixing the prices. There is lack of transparency for the patients in the US healthcare system. There should be a regular body which can keep eye on the hospitals and must fix the prices across the states.
