This is a case study about the US hospital charges for different DRG's. In this report we are going to explore the different rates at which patients were charged in different hospitals across the states. This will show how the price for the similar diagnosis or same treatment within the same city can vary in a different way across disimmilar providers.


The dataset includes the following columns:

1. **DRG Definition**: A description of one of the 100 most common diagnostic resource groups
2. **Provider Id**: The numerical identifier for a specific hospital
3. **Provider Name**: The name of the same hospital
4. **Provider Street Address**: The street address of the same hospital
5. **Provider City**: The city where this specific hospital is located
6. **Provider State**: The state where this specific hospital is located
7. **Provider Zip Code**: The zip code where this specific hospital is located
8. **Hospital Referral Region (HRR) Description**: The Hospital Referral Region (regional health care market for tertiary medical care) where this specific hospital is located.
9. **Total Discharges**: The total number of patients who were released from this specific inpatient hospital after receiving care related to this specific DRG.
10. **Average Covered Charges**: The amount of money charged by the hospital for this medical procedure (how much the provider charges to Medicare).
11. **Average Total Payments**: The amount of money received by the hospital for this medical procedure (This includes the reimbursement from Medicare, as well as third party payments for coordinating benefits, and any co-payment)
12. **Average Medicare Payments**: The amount of money that Medicare has reimbursed to the hospital for this medical procedure.

There were more than 100 DRG's or treatment types. After the patient was charged, some of the payment was made by medical insurance provider and the third party insurance provider. The rest was paid by the patient himself.

In the analysis, it is found that **Maryland** state is providing efficient health services at cheapest prices as compared to the rest of the states. No matter, what the treatment is. On the other hand, **California** is charging much higher prices to the patient. There is no standard system in the USA responsible for fixing the prices. *There is lack of transparency for the patients in the US healthcare system. There should be a regular body which can keep eye on the hospitals and must fix the prices across the states.*
